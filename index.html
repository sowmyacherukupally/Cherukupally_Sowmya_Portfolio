  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Apple builds products that set global standards for intelligence, privacy, quality, and user experience. I bring the engineering depth, decision-making clarity, and AI/ML evaluation expertise needed to make Apple Intelligence smarter, more reliable, and more impactful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of contributing to organizations where reliability, scale, and user trust aren’t just expectations — they’re the foundation of every decision. At USAA Bank, I strengthened large-scale financial systems by improving backend performance, stabilizing mission-critical services, and building user-centric interfaces that made complex banking workflows feel simpler and more intuitive. At Paytm, I engineered high-volume transaction systems, automated operational workflows, improved data accessibility, and built distributed architectures that served millions of users across diverse financial products. These experiences taught me how to design systems that remain resilient under pressure, operate securely by default, and deliver seamless experiences even at massive scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      What excites me about Apple is not just its products, it’s the philosophy behind them: thoughtful design, uncompromising privacy, human-centered engineering, and the constant pursuit of innovation that genuinely improves people’s lives. Whether it’s Apple Intelligence, Health technologies, or the next generation of platform tools, I see a place where my experience can translate into meaningful impact. My background in building reliable backend services, scalable data pipelines, intuitive UIs, distributed systems, and evaluation frameworks positions me to contribute to Apple’s mission of creating technology that feels personal, empowering, and trustworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m inspired by Apple’s commitment to transforming everyday interactions from intelligent assistants and seamless device experiences to health insights that guide better living — and I want to help push those boundaries even further. With my experience in secure financial engineering, large-scale platform development, and data-intensive systems, I’m confident in my ability to help Apple build products and infrastructures that are faster, smarter, safer, and even more human. My goal is simple: to contribute to innovations that millions of people rely on every day, and to uphold Apple’s vision of engineering excellence with purpose.
