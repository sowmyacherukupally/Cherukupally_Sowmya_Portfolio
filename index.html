  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Full-Stack Engineer with 4+ years of experience designing scalable, secure, and distributed cloud-native systems across AI/ML platforms, health technologies, and financial services. I specialize in Python, Go, Java, Node.js, React, and TypeScript, building high-performance backend services, automated ML evaluation pipelines, microservices, and internal developer tools used across large engineering organizations.
    </p>

    <p>
      My experience spans highly regulated financial environments at USAA Bank and Paytm, where I built fault-tolerant, event-driven systems, optimized transaction pipelines, improved fraud analytics, and delivered low-latency APIs that enhanced data integrity, reliability, and security. My work at Infor as an intern strengthened my foundation in enterprise product development, backend integration, and software quality practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have designed ML evaluation workflows, data ingestion systems, distributed processing pipelines, full-stack internal dashboards, and secure cloud architectures across AWS and GCP—driving improvements in model quality, system throughput, observability, and developer productivity. I excel at collaborating with ML researchers, data scientists, platform engineers, and product teams, translating complex requirements into user-centric, privacy-focused solutions that scale to millions of Apple users. My goal is to build platforms and backend systems that elevate Apple’s Intelligence, Health, and platform-wide experiences.

<!-- WHY APPLE SHOULD HIRE ME -->
<div class="section" id="why-apple">
  <h2>Why Apple Should Hire Me</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>
      Apple builds products that set global standards for intelligence, privacy, quality, and user experience. I bring the engineering depth, decision-making clarity, and AI/ML evaluation expertise needed to make Apple Intelligence smarter, more reliable, and more impactful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout my career, I’ve contributed to organizations where reliability, scale, and user trust are the foundation of every decision. At USAA Bank, I strengthened financial systems by improving backend performance, stabilizing mission-critical services, and building user-centric interfaces. At Paytm, I engineered high-volume distributed systems, automated workflows, improved data accessibility, and built architectures serving millions. These experiences taught me how to design systems that stay resilient under pressure, operate securely by default, and deliver seamless experiences at massive scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      What excites me about Apple is not just its products, it’s the philosophy: thoughtful design, uncompromising privacy, human-centered engineering, and the pursuit of innovation that genuinely improves lives. Whether it’s Apple Intelligence, Health technologies, or platform-wide tools, I see a place where my experience creates real impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      With my background in reliable backend systems, scalable data pipelines, intuitive UIs, distributed systems, and evaluation frameworks, I can help Apple build products that feel personal, empowering, and trustworthy. My goal is simple: contribute to innovations millions rely on daily and uphold Apple's vision of engineering excellence with purpose.
